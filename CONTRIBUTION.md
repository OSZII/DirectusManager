## ⚖️ The Attribution Rule (Important!)

To keep this project free and open, I ask for one simple thing in return: **the footer must stay.**

The footer contains a link to my portfolio and the source code repository. Per the [LICENSE](./LICENSE), you are not allowed to hide, remove, or obscure this section.

### Adding Your Own Credit

I love seeing what people build! If you make significant changes and want to add your name to the project, please do so by appending it to the existing footer.

**Correct way to add your name:**

```html
